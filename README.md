# SeruloCodefest2021
This is the source code for my game made in Unity and C#

# Controls

WASD: Move
E: Infect Player if they are in 10m radius and you are infected
X: Toggle open shop regardless of infection

# Instructions

This game is about 2-4 players being teleported to an island and they are told that
the last player alive will survive. They have to keep their resistance to the virus, "Serulo",
up, otherwise they will be infected by it. They can increase their resistance by collecting
randomly spawning yellow orbs, or buying a resistance booster like a carrot from the shop.
If their resistance reaches 0, then they are infected and can only be disinfected by either infecting
another player or by buying a vaccine from the shop. If you are infected for 30 seconds, you will die
and spectate the rest of the match. You can buy items from the shop by using currency which you get 
75 of every 10 seconds and 25 by collecing yellow orbs. If only one player remains alive, then 
all players will see that players name displayed as the victor.
